# **Ecommerce Customer Analysis & Linear Regression Model**

This project involves analyzing ecommerce customer data to predict the yearly amount spent by customers. We explore relationships between factors such as time spent on the website, time spent on the app, and membership length, and how they impact spending behavior.

## **Overview**

- **Data**: The dataset includes features like average session length, time on app, time on website, and membership duration.  
- **Objective**: Predict yearly customer spend based on customer activity.  
- **Approach**: Perform data exploration and build a linear regression model to understand key factors influencing spending.

## **Features of the Project**

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Analyze relationships between customer features and spending through visualizations.  

2. **Model Building**  
   Train a linear regression model using key customer behavior features to predict the yearly amount spent.  

3. **Model Evaluation**  
   Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and residual analysis.
