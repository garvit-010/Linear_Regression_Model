Ecommerce Customer Analysis & Linear Regression Model
This project involves analyzing ecommerce customer data to predict the yearly amount spent by customers. We explore relationships between factors such as time spent on the website, time spent on the app, and membership length, and how they impact spending behavior.

Key Sections:
Data Analysis: Initial exploration and visualization of customer behaviors.
Model Building: Using Linear Regression to predict yearly customer spend based on various factors.
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance with metrics like Mean Squared Error and plotting residuals.
Dependencies:
Python libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
